  My Book List includes books like Autobiographies, Biographies, History,
  Scientific Matters, Spiritual, Paranormal, Self-Improvement, Business, Social
  Psychology, Technology and more. I'm an avid reader and enjoy exploring new
  topics for increasing my knowledge and experience with those topics. My time
  on a topic does not stop with just reading a book, many times, it is just the
  beginning of the journey to discover more about each subject and the ideas
  presented or discussed. Knowledge is power and the use of that knowledge, with
  proper preparation, can come at crucial times which may be completely
  unexpected.
